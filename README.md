Visit http://guarded-bayou-98375.herokuapp.com to view the hosted website. 

The website was made with Laravel and hosted using Heroku. 

I used Bootstrap for the front-end design, vanilla JavaScript for simple changing buttons, 
PHP for signing-up, logging in and the message system and plain HTML for the contact form that is functional thanks to https://formsubmit.co.
